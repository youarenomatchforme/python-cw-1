# Change the following print statement so that it uses the addition operator + and prints out 8
sum1 = 4+4
print(sum1)
# Write a print statement that uses the division operator /
sum2 = 25/5

# Add a print statement that uses multiplication *
sum3 = 4*4

# Create a variable called `length` and assign a value to it
length = 3
# Create a variable called    `width` and assign a value to it
width = 7
# Create a variable called `area` and assign to it the multiplication of `length` and `width`
area = length * width
# Print `area` in the following: "The result is " followed by the `area` variable
print(f"the result is {area}")
# BONUS: Print the area in the following syntax: "If the length of a rectangle is 5, and width is 3 then the area is: 15". Keep in mind that you should replace the numbers with their respective variables.
